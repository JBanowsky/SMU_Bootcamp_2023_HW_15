This activity is the SMU Boot Camp Module 15 Challenge.
All code was resourced from the SMU Boot Camp Class.

Programs used:
Visual Studio Code
GitHub

Objective: Create an Earthquake Visulatization using data from the U.S. Geological Survey and leaflet. https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
The visualization distinguishes earthquakes based on magnitude and depth.

I started by fetching earth quake data for the past week using D3.json.
I created functions to label each marker, establish the marker size based on magnitude, and marker color based on depth range.
I used www.openstreetmap.org to create the map layer. 

I uploaded a the html to GitHub.
